# MyCMD
A classical Molecular Dynamics simulation program.

It is based on:
* Verlet List Method
* LJ potentials
* Velocity Verlet algorithm.

My first try at molecular dynamics (❁´ω`❁)


The simulation parameters are in the following file
```
input.json
```

To run the simulation
```
python run.py
```
